# MusicButton


Do you like music?

Do you like to discover new things?

Do you NOT like to make a lot of movements for simple operations? So am I! That's how the MusicButton app appeared.

This app allows you to mark the track you like in Apple Music library by one touch!

You have no longer to switch between applications, lose concentration: just click on the heart in the status bar and press Enter or assign a global keyboard shortcut!
